## MultiAgent Analyst System


An agentic AI system built using LangGraph, designed to automatically analyze datasets, generate insights, visualize data trends, and produce a professional PDF report — all in one automated pipeline.

This project implements a modular agentic data analysis pipeline powered by LangGraph.
Each step of the analysis (data parsing, insight generation, visualization, and report creation) is handled by a separate agent node, connected via a graph-based workflow.


*Automated Data Parsing – Detects data types, missing values, and summary stats

*Insight Generation – Extracts meaningful trends and correlations (via LLM or rule-based)

*Visualization Node – Generates graphs and charts from the dataset

*Report Generator – Compiles all results into a clean, ready-to-share PDF

*LangGraph Integration – Provides modular, state-based execution with full traceability
